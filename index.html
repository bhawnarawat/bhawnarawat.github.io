        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I’m a digital artist who likes using the right tool for the right job, for example, for UX/UI projects, some of the used tools are Figma, Sketch, Miro, Zeplin, Lookback while for my more artistic. My recent project is a mobile Hotel app for people who struggle to find a better hotel for business, parties and trip purpose. it stands out through some new tech features.<br>

            Besides my bachelor’s degree, the most relevant from a designer’s perspective are UI/UX Design courses from Udemy and Udacity.<br>

            I’ve been always passionate about my work, friends would add that I’m a very empathic person, eager to discover more about digital world. I’m inspired by everything around me and every new project is a source of energy.<br>

            So far, I’ve worked very well both in team projects or alone. I'm motivated by the team/company, Co-Workers and working environment. The most important thing for me is professional development and self-overcoming, and the greatest satisfaction is when I successfully meet all the required objectives.<br>
